Sending webhook requests every 24 hours with the latest Coronavirus data.

The API used to retrieve virus stats can be found [on my gist here](https://gist.github.com/Xetera/cdd3b9457510cb8d3a5b85a8fc30891c).

If the world hasn't ended yet and you'd like to be added to the updates list (and don't mind giving me your webhook url) hit me up at Xetera#0001 on Discord.
